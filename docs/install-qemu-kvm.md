# Install QEMU/KVM on Ubuntu 22.04

Install QEMU/KVM and libvirtd

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system
# if you want to install images from ISOs with virt-install
sudo apt-get install virtinst
```

Make sure the current user is a member of the libvirt and kvm groups

```
$ sudo adduser $(id -un) libvirt
Adding user '<username>' to group 'libvirt' ...
$ sudo adduser $(id -un) kvm
Adding user '<username>' to group 'kvm' ...
```

Run `virt-host-validate` to check your setup:

```
virt-host-validate qemu
$ virt-host-validate qemu

X86_64-based machines will likely display a warning about cgroup devices controller
support not being enabled. This allos you to apply resource management to virtual
machines. For more information refer to [this doc](https://libvirt.org/cgroups.html).
To add cgroup 'devices' controller support, edit `/etc/default/grub`
and change the line that looks like `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"`
to:
```
# GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_iommu=on systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
```

And then run `update-grub` to update your boot options:

```
sudo update-grub
```

Reboot and then everything in `virt-host-validate` should pass. The tool
can't validate secure guest support on Intel chips, only on AMD or IBM
processors, so the warning is accurate there: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65207563/qemu-warn-unknown-if-this-platform-has-secure-guest-support

Also make sure that the packages with the UEFI firmware are present - on Ubuntu these should be
installed automatically when `qemu-kvm` is installed:
```
# Open Virtual Machine Firmware for X86-64 processors
# Files are in /usr/share/OVMF
sudo apt-get install ovmf
# ARM Architecture Virtual Machine firmware
# Files are in /usr/share/AAVMF
sudo apt-get install qemu-efi-aarch64
```

## Configure bridged networking

All the networking options for kvm are just different configurations for a virtual networking
switch, also known as a bridge network interface.

The default network created when libvirt is used is called `default` and uses NAT. It normally
is configured to use a bridge network interface called `virbr0`. When a virtual machine is
on a NAT network, it is on a separate subnet that prevents outside access to the VM directly,
nwhile the VM itself can access any network the host can access.

With bridged networking, the VM will be on the same network as the host. It can be accessed
by all computers on your host network as if it were another computer directly connected to
the same network.

On Ubuntu, determine if the host interface is managed by `systemd-networkd` or `NetworkManager`.
Usually if you are using Ubuntu Desktop, it's `NetworkManager`, and if you are using
Ubuntu Server, it's `systemd-networkd`, but it can vary.

Running `networkctl` will tell you is `systemd-networkd` is running and if an interface
is being managed. The default configuration on Ubuntu Desktop should show that
`systemd-networkd` is not running and the interfaces are not being managed (by `systemd-networkd`).

```
$ networkctl
WARNING: systemd-networkd is not running, output will be incomplete.
