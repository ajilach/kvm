# Install QEMU/KVM on Ubuntu 22.04

Install QEMU/KVM and libvirtd

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system
# if you want to install images from ISOs with virt-install
sudo apt-get install virtinst
```

Make sure the current user is a member of the libvirt and kvm groups

```
$ sudo adduser $(id -un) libvirt
Adding user '<username>' to group 'libvirt' ...
$ sudo adduser $(id -un) kvm
Adding user '<username>' to group 'kvm' ...
```

Run `virt-host-validate` to check your setup:

```
virt-host-validate qemu
$ virt-host-validate qemu

X86_64-based machines will likely display a warning about cgroup devices controller
support not being enabled. This allos you to apply resource management to virtual
machines. For more information refer to [this doc](https://libvirt.org/cgroups.html).
To add cgroup 'devices' controller support, edit `/etc/default/grub`
and change the line that looks like `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"`
to:
```
# GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_iommu=on systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
```

And then run `update-grub` to update your boot options:

```
sudo update-grub
```

Reboot and then everything in `virt-host-validate` should pass. The tool
can't validate secure guest support on Intel chips, only on AMD or IBM
processors, so the warning is accurate there: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65207563/qemu-warn-unknown-if-this-platform-has-secure-guest-support

Also make sure that the packages with the UEFI firmware are present - on Ubuntu these should be
installed automatically when `qemu-kvm` is installed:
```
# Open Virtual Machine Firmware for X86-64 processors
# Files are in /usr/share/OVMF
sudo apt-get install ovmf
# ARM Architecture Virtual Machine firmware
# Files are in /usr/share/AAVMF
sudo apt-get install qemu-efi-aarch64
```
